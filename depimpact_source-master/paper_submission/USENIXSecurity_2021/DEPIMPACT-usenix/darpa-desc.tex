\subsubsection{DARPA TC Attack Cases}
The dataset released by the DARPA TC program contains attack cases performed on different operating systems.
Based on the attack descriptions provided in the dataset, we exclude the attack cases that fail to launch the attacks, and the attack cases on the Android system since mobile applications' behaviors are constrained by the Android sandbox and are not suitable for our analysis.
We also exclude the phishing e-mail attacks since most of their operations are through clicking links in the browsers and leave limited traces in the system audit logs.
In total, we chosen five attacks that target at different operating systems (Linux, Windows) and exploit different vulnerabilities (Firefox backdoor and browser extensions). 

% Once we got the dependency graph of the malicious behavior, we used \tool to further process and detect the critical component of each attack.
