\section{Conclusion}
We propose a novel approach, \tool, which assigns discriminative weights to edges in a dependency graph 
built from system auditing events
and propagates reputation scores in the weighted graph from seed sources to POI events.
The discriminative edge weights enable \tool to reveal critical edges for automatically reconstructing the attack sequence.
The reputation propagation paradigm enables \tool to automatically determine the suspiciousness/trustworthiness of POI entities based on whether the system entities originate from suspicious sources or trusted sources.
The synergy of attack sequence reconstruction and reputation propagation makes \tool the first step towards automatic attack investigation. 
The evaluations on system tasks that inject benign and malicious payloads through key system interfaces and real APT attacks demonstrate that 
(1) \tool effectively propagates reputation since POI entities receive expected reputation scores in both benign and malicious scenarios;
(2) \tool effectively reveals critical edges since the computed weights for the critical edges are well separated from the computed weights for the non-critical edges.
These results make \tool the first step towards automatic attack investigation.
