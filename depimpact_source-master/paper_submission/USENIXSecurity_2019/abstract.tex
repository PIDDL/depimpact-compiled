The need for countering Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks has led to solution that ubiquitously
monitor system activities in each host, and perform timely attack investigation over the monitoring data.
However, existing solutions face major limitations in automating the process of attack investigation:
(1) causality analysis requires security analysts to inspect a large system dependency graph, 
where nodes represent system entities and edges represent the dependencies among system auditing events;
(2) behavior querying requires security analysts to master the query syntax and manually construct behavior queries to search attack patterns.

In this work, we propose a novel approach, \tool, which makes the first step towards automatic attack investigation.
\tool assigns discriminative weights to the edges in a system dependency graph to distinguish \emph{critical edges} that are important to revealing the attack sequence, and propagates reputation values from seed sources to suspicious system entities.
The reputation propagation enables \tool to automatically determine whether a system entity came from a trusted or a suspicious source, and the edge weights enable \tool to automatically reveal critical edges for reconstructing the attack sequence.
The evaluations on a wide range of attacks on key system interfaces and real 
APT attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of \tool in reputation propagation and attack sequence reconstruction.
