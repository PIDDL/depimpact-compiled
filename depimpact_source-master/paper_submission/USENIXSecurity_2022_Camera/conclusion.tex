\section{Conclusion}
We propose \tool, a framework that identifies the critical component of 
a dependency graph of a POI event generated by causality analysis, which preserves attack information and filter out irrelevant dependencies.
%
Specifically, \tool assigns discriminative dependency weights to edges for revealing critical edges, and computes and propagates dependency impacts to entry nodes for revealing attack entries. 
%for distinguishing critical edges that represent attack sequences from non-critical edges,
%and computes for each node based on the dependency weights to rank the entry nodes, with the top ones likely to be attack entries.
By further performing forward causality analysis from the top-ranked entry nodes and taking the graph overlap, \tool preserves only dependencies that are highly relevant to the POI event and attack entries.
Our evaluations on real attacks demonstrate the effectiveness of \tool in filtering out irrelevant dependencies (producing $\sim6,250\times$ smaller graphs) while preserving the attack-relevant dependencies.
%without missing any critical edge.
