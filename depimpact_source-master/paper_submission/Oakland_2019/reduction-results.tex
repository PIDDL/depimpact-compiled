\subsubsection{Graph Reduction Results}
\label{subsec:graphreduction}

\input{tables/ReductionResult.tex}

\cref{tab:Reduction} shows the reduction in the number of nodes and in the number of edges after causality analysis (\cref{subsec:graph-generation}) and edge merge (\cref{subsec:graph-preprocessing}).
As we can see, the reduction is significant: (1) In most of the cases, \tool achieves more than half of nodes reduced. Causality analysis helps trim up to 72.8\% nodes on average.
(2) In most of the cases, \tool achieves more than 95\% of edges reduced. Edge merge helps trim up to 97.74\% edges on average.

To surface critical edges, \tool uses a threshold to hide non-critical edges.
To provide a guidance on selecting this threshold, we test the filtering performance by selecting an increasing multiple of average weight of the whole graph from 0 to 2 with a pace of 0.05.
We define the \emph{threshold} as the average weight of the whole graph magnified by a number $T_w$ (\ie threshold multiplier). 
%
\cref{fig:edge-thresh} shows the average percentage of edges remaining of all cases after filtering. We observe a turning point at $T_w = 0.15$ and the number of remaining edges will remain stable below 20\%. Higher thresholds can lead to more graph size reduction. However, if we choose the threshold too high, we will lose track of some of the critical edges. 
%
We define the \emph{missing point} as the exact threshold multiplier that leads to the first critical edge loss(\cref{tab:filter}). 
\cref{fig:cdf} shows the cumulative distribution of missing points.
We observe that: 
(1) Two cases (\emph{command-injection-c2}, \emph{data-leakage}) have extremely high missing points ($T_w > 200$);
(2) 5 out of 21 cases lost critical edges at $T_w = 2$. However, in these 5 cases, 2 of them(\emph{Shell-wget},\emph{penetration-c1}) already have less than 10 non-critical edges at missing point and 3 of them also have significant reduction in edge numbers(\cref{tab:filter}).
(3) A plateau exists before $T_w = 2$ at a rate of 24\%. This indicate most of the cases have a missing point greater than $T_w = 2$, which proves the efficacy of our weights to differ critical edges from non-critical edges.

Given that setting $T_w = 0.15$ is enough to filter out more than 80\% of the non-critical edges and 76\% of the cases have $T_w > 2$. A good strategy would be examining the graph at $T_w = 2$ to grab a rough sense then tuning down to $T_w = 0.15$ to review details. To avoid critical edge miss in some situation, then going down to $T_w = 0$. Rather than directly examine the graph after Edge Merge, this will save a lot of daunting labor.
