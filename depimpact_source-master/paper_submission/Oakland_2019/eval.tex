\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Evaluation Setup}
The evaluations are conducted on a laptop with an Intel(R) Core(R) i5-3210M CPU (2.5GHz), 8GB RAM running 64bit Ubuntu 18.04.1.
%We use Sysdig as system auditing tool, the version is 0.24.1. 
We constructed 11 cases for key system interfaces that are vulnerable for attacks and 10 cases for key steps in real APT attacks.
We evaluate the effectiveness of \tool in surfacing critical edges and propagating reputation from seeds to identify benign and malicious payloads.

% \subsection{Evaluation Results}
% To evaluate the accuracy and effect of our method, we prepared 20 cases. There are 10 cases covering the most common user activities including file read/write, network download and decompress. Table~\ref{tab:benignHighRP} shows the reputation result of four methods.
% Table~\ref{tab:Reduction} shows our method reduction rate.

\subsubsection{Representative Cases for Key System Interfaces}
\label{subsub:benign-cases}
We constructed 11 representative cases that employ the common system interfaces that vulnerable for attacks~\cite{securitybook}.


\begin{itemize}[noitemsep, topsep=1pt, partopsep=1pt, listparindent=\parindent, leftmargin=*]
\item File merge: \emph{2File}, \emph{3File}, \emph{USB-merge} (files stored in a USB drive)

\item Invoke shell script: \emph{shell-script} (list all files in the Home folder and write the results to a file)

\item File download: \emph{curl}, \emph{wget}, \emph{shell-wget} (wget called by a shell script), \emph{python-wget} (wget called by a Python script)

\item File download then decompress: \emph{shell-wget-unzip}, \emph{python-wget-unzip}

\item File transfer: \emph{scp}
\end{itemize}
